# KitchenSync Monorepo

This repository is organized as a minimal monorepo with separate backend and frontend workspaces.

## Structure

- `backend/` — Python project skeleton suitable for a Flask backend.
- `frontend/` — Vite + React + TypeScript project skeleton.

## Backend Setup (placeholder)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask entrypoint via `python run.py` from `backend/`.

## Frontend Setup (placeholder)

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` inside `frontend/`.
2. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
3. Build production assets with `npm run build`.

## Notes

- Backend server implementation is intentionally not included yet.
- Frontend UI implementation is intentionally minimal.
